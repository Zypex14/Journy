(Exposition)The beginning{
    This is the exposition of the story. There are no specific details, because this is just
    used for coding. This is going to be one of many tests that I will use to make sure
    my code works. The paragraph just has to have some sorts of words in them, so it best simulates
    the decryptor. This decryptor or compiler converts this text into meaningful functions. So
    basically it is a programming language. Yeah, I coded my own programming language.
